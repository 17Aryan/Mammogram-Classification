# Mammogram-Classification
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for the classification of mammogram images into benign and malignant cases. The goal is to aid in the early detection of breast cancer, which can significantly improve patient outcomes.
# Preprocessing
Before training the classification model, it is necessary to preprocess the mammogram images. This includes steps such as resizing, normalization, and potentially applying image enhancement techniques.
